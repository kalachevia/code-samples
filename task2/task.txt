There is a graph - road system. Each link has weight and each node has status, role and id:

    Link weight. This is the time is taken to move from one node to another and vice verse by car.
    Node status. Only one possible value is "crash". If it's set then car cannot go to that specific node (so it will be like 
    Node id. The identifier for internal system usage.
    Node role can be either start or finish.

You need to find a shortest way from "start node" to "finish node":

1.  The car starts from start node and must find the optimal way (by time) to finish node.
2.  Consider that link can only have one weight. Back way takes the same time.
3.  Application must report any errors to user (incorrect xml, no route, no start node etc).
4.  Application should shows user the shortest way as array of node id's.
5.  Application must parse xml file for input data (see below for file structure). Sample file see in attachment.
6.  Application reads the road system from external xml file.
